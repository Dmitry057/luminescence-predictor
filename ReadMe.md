## Description

The Luminescence Predictor is a project that aims to predict luminescence parameters for organic molecules. It utilizes data on absorption and emission spectra to generate molecular structures and predict their luminescent properties.

## Features

- Predict luminescence parameters for organic molecules
- Generate molecular structures based on absorption and emission spectra
- Provide insights into luminescent properties of molecules

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/luminescence-predictor.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python luminescence_predictor.py
    ```

2. Follow the prompts to input the absorption and emission spectra data.

3. The program will generate molecular structures and predict their luminescent properties.
